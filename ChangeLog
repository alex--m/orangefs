=======

Rev 10182

* Reworked usrint initialization to support fork/exec effectively,
* particularly for shells (like bash).  File descriptors were moved to
* a Posix shared memory object so that they can be passed from parent
* to child in a fork and from one program to the next in an exec.  Fork
* creates a new shm object and copies the parent's into it.  Exec takes
* over the previous program's object but must modify internal pointers.
* program loading OFS usrint for the first time creates and initializes
* a new object.  File descriptor status structs can be shared from
* parent to child on a fork.  Shared synchronization is used to manage
* access to these objects.  Management of free space in the shared
* objects is done in unshared user space memory using fairly simple
* free lists.
*
* Added features to gen_locks to initialize recursive and shared mutexes
* and shared conds for use in the new usrint features.

Rev 10075

* Added support for glob in usrint
*
* Fixed several bugs that involved using an uncleared buffer that becomes
* corrupted.
*
* Added a malloc and associated functions wrapper that uses #defines to
* replace malloc with PINT-malloc().  PINT-malloc() uses glibc malloc() (and not
* a client program's replacement for malloc) to do memory management.  Inserts 
* a magic number before each allocated buffer that is check on free to prevent
* a number of common malloc related bugs.  Zeros newly allocarted buffer.
* Zeros buffer being freed.  Can be adapted for other uses as well.  Includes
* malloc debugging calls (currently controlled distinctly from gossip but
* will be integrated into gossip).  Configure options can turn off some or
* all of these features.  Also incAudes a set of functions clean-malloc() that
* calls to the default version of malloc().  This makes pint-mem.c obsolete.
*
* Began migrating to a new initialization mechanism that uses a feature of
* GCC __attrubute__((constructor)) that causes a routine to run before main.
* This should enable us to remove the many calls to init routines currently in
* the usrint code.  May not work on other compilers, but there may be an 
* older alternative.  Worst case we replace the many calls with macros.  A
* similar destructor attribute exists for shutdown
*
* Reworked implementation of stdin, stdout, stderr so that we can use them
* effectively with freopen and OrangeFS files.  Reworked freopen to support
* this.  Can still be disabled with configure.
*
* Made some changes to handling of locks in streams.

orangefs-2.8.7 (Subversion Tag v2.8.7)
>>>>>>> .merge-right.r10075

Trunk

* New Feature: added human readable times to pvfs2-db-display.  Rev 9366.

* New Feature:  when setting the mode (admin or normal) of a filesystem 
* using pvfs2-set-mode, you can now do so for individual servers.  Prior
* to this change, the mode was set for all the servers within a particular 
* filesystem.

* New Feature: users can now specify at configure time how they want the
* kernel module to handle the file pointer when an error occurs.  The
* default behavior is to leave the file pointer alone, i.e., the file
* pointer will always represent the position of the last byte written,
* even though the user's entire request is not totally satisfied. In 
* this case, a the actual number of bytes written is returned to the user.
* The new feature will change this default behavior such that the file pointer
* is repositioned to the byte just prior to the user's write request, a
* -1 is returned to the user's call, and errno is appropriately set.  To
* enable this feature, add --enable-reset-file-pos on the configure
* command line when your OrangeFS system is configured.

* Bug fix:  modified pvfs2_readdir, which is executed by the kernel module
* on behalf of an "ls", to properly retry or quit when pvfs2-client-core
* aborts/restarts or when pvfs2-client terminates.  Prior to these
* changes, pvfs2_readdir could possibly corrupt another process's "ls"
* command by releasing access to a shared memory buffer index that may
* be legitimately in use.

* Bug fix:  modified the kernel code to re-post data to the shared memory
* system (for I/O requests) whenever pvfs2-client-core aborts.  Because the 
* data was not re-posted prior to these changes, the resulting file contained 
* corrupted data.

* New Feature: added hint support to pvfs_open() to allow user to
* provide various things like the number of servers to use, the
* distribution to use, the layout to use, as well as tags that can be
* used to trace requests.

* New Feature: added new layout LOCAL which puts a file on the server on
* the same node as the client, if there is one.  Otherwise defaults to
* ROUND_ROBIN

* Bug Fix: repaired a bug in the layout processing

* Bug Fix: fixed some problems with void pointers and replaced a missing
* function prototype

* Bug Fix: Corrected a long time bug: if the number of unexpected requests
defined in the config file is greater than 64, then the code inadvertently
used invalid job_status_s addresses when calling
server_post_unexpected_recv(). If a failure occurs, the error code in the
status structure is updated with the error value. In this case, the code would
NOT segfault, because the address is actually within valid address space on
the heap; however, the code would be overwriting other global structures, like
the known_method_table, etc. To correct this problem, I use a local
job_status_s structure inside the server_post_unexpected_recv(). Please read
the comments in that function to understand why this works.
