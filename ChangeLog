PVFS2 Release ChangeLog
-----------------------


pvfs2-0.0.7pre1
===============
- 

pvfs2-0.0.6
===========
- improved kernel truncate support
- fixed kernel ioctl return values
  (so that 'tar -xv[z|j]f' can work on pvfs2 volumes)
- minor configuration file format changes
- improved performance monitoring framework
- pvfs2-vis-bw-2d tool for server throughput monitoring
- many symbol name cleanups
- removal of deprecated code
- kernel inode link count fixes
- bucketized (single indirection) 'on-disk' representation of
  bstream and keyval files in the host storage space
- a pvfs2_rmspace (opposite of mkspace); can be invoked by server
  using the -r command line option
- added kernel module highmem support
- renamed attribute cache 'pcache' to 'acache'
- large file support bug fixes
- improved client sysint rename implementation (state-machine)
- improved signal handling in pvfs2-client
- switch to a new protocol encoder which translates requests and
  responses into a machine-independent format, allowing
  interoperability between 32- and 64-bit machines and little-
  and big-endian machines.
	
	
pvfs2-0.0.5
===========
- clean compilation on 64-bit machines
- vfs stability improvements during I/O, including across client restarts
- statfs reporting improvements (closer to correct)
- sysint remove method fix to properly clean up datafiles
- partial path symlink resolution support
- vfs symlink resolution/following support (including partial path)
- added sysint parameter to sys_lookup that dictates if the final
  object on lookup should be resolved if it's a symlink
- runtime options to choose request encoder (see pvfs2tab man page)
- new, much faster, default flow protocol
- streamlined support for threaded and non-threaded server builds


pvfs2-0.0.4
===========
- improved truncate support (pcache usage/integration)
- kernel truncate support (improved file size reporting)
- removed several run-time verbose (expected) warnings
- fixed a handle rollover bug in extentlist handler
- fixed bit-rotted non-threaded trove/job compilation
- improved client sysint readdir implementation (state-machine)
- improved client sysint mkdir implementation (state-machine)
- improved client sysint setattr implementation (state-machine)
- improved client sysint lookup implementation (state-machine)
- symlink resolution/following support
- multiple metadata server configurations are now supported
- pvfs2-genconfig can now generate multiple metadata server configurations
- pav and pvfs2-genconfig now run in 'perl -w' mode w/o any warnings
- added event logging framework, instrumented a few code paths
- example tools to manage event log (pvfs2-set-eventmask and
  pvfs2-event-mon-example)
- started some example perf monitor visualization tools, src/apps/vis subdir
- new network encoding for heterogeneous systems (le-bytefield)
- env variable to set client side debugging level
