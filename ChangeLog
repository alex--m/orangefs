PVFS2 Release ChangeLog
-----------------------


pvfs2-0.0.7pre2
===============
- re-worked architecture of metadata storage (generic dspace attrs are
  used instead of a separate keyval/data pair)
- added a server-side (trove-dbpf) attribute write-through caching layer
  for caching generic attributes and keyval/data pairs that are user
  configurable
- added a readahead data cache specifically for vfs mmap-read and
  execution, improving their performance greatly (running, editing,
  compiling, etc on a pvfs2 volume is now much more responsive)
- fix size reporting using 'du' through the vfs interface
- GNU/Linux PowerPC 32bit support, including the 2.6.x kernel interface
- updated pvfs2-genconfig to account for new config file format
- fixed an I/O bug that caused data access problems on some multiple
  I/O server configurations
- removed extra berkeley db error reporting since it's not integrated with
  our gossip error reporting system.  can now be explicitly enabled using
  a new configure option --with-berkdb-debug
- fixes to state machine compiler to workaround hangs on some machines
- new scripts in maint/build for building and testing PVFS2
- better balancing (randomization) of metadata server selection when
  creating new files and directories
- various error msg cleanups (in several components)
- mutex locking improvements, allowing support for NPTL thread
  implementations and also improving performance for some operations


pvfs2-0.0.6
===========
- improved kernel truncate support
- fixed kernel ioctl return values
  (so that 'tar -xv[z|j]f' can work on pvfs2 volumes)
- minor configuration file format changes
- improved performance monitoring framework
- pvfs2-vis-bw-2d tool for server throughput monitoring
- many symbol name cleanups
- removal of deprecated code
- kernel inode link count fixes
- bucketized (single indirection) 'on-disk' representation of
  bstream and keyval files in the host storage space
- a pvfs2_rmspace (opposite of mkspace); can be invoked by server
  using the -r command line option
- added kernel module highmem support
- renamed attribute cache 'pcache' to 'acache'
- large file support bug fixes
- improved client sysint rename implementation (state-machine)
- improved signal handling in pvfs2-client
- switch to a new protocol encoder which translates requests and
  responses into a machine-independent format, allowing
  interoperability between 32- and 64-bit machines and little-
  and big-endian machines.
	
	
pvfs2-0.0.5
===========
- clean compilation on 64-bit machines

- statfs reporting improvements (closer to correct)
- sysint remove method fix to properly clean up datafiles
- partial path symlink resolution support
- vfs symlink resolution/following support (including partial path)
- added sysint parameter to sys_lookup that dictates if the final
  object on lookup should be resolved if it's a symlink
- runtime options to choose request encoder (see pvfs2tab man page)
- new, much faster, default flow protocol
- streamlined support for threaded and non-threaded server builds


pvfs2-0.0.4
===========

- kernel truncate support (improved file size reporting)
- removed several run-time verbose (expected) warnings
- fixed a handle rollover bug in extentlist handler
- fixed bit-rotted non-threaded trove/job compilation
- improved client sysint readdir implementation (state-machine)
- improved client sysint mkdir implementation (state-machine)
- improved client sysint setattr implementation (state-machine)
- improved client sysint lookup implementation (state-machine)
- symlink resolution/following support
- multiple metadata server configurations are now supported
- pvfs2-genconfig can now generate multiple metadata server configurations
- pav and pvfs2-genconfig now run in 'perl -w' mode w/o any warnings
- added event logging framework, instrumented a few code paths
- example tools to manage event log (pvfs2-set-eventmask and
  pvfs2-event-mon-example)
- started some example perf monitor visualization tools, src/apps/vis subdir
- new network encoding for heterogeneous systems (le-bytefield)
- env variable to set client side debugging level
