\section{Tuning PVFS2}
\label{sec:tuning}

The default settings -- those provided by \texttt{pvfs2-genconfig} --
will give correct behavior and decent performance.   You can use more
aggressive settings that will yield better performance, but you should
understand the consequences of altering the defaults.

\subsection{Sync Mode}

The easiest way to see an improvement in performance is to set the
\texttt{TroveSyncMeta} and \texttt{TroveSyncData} attributes to ``no''
in the \texttt{<StorageHints>} section.  If those attributes are set to
``no'' then Trove will read and write data from a cache and not the
underlying file.  Performance will increase greatly, but if the server
dies at some point, you could lose data.  At this point in PVFS2
development, server crashes are rare outside of hardware failures.
PVFS2 developers should probably leave these settings to ``yes''.  If
PVFS2 hosts the only copy of your data, leave these settings to ``yes''.
Otherwise, give ``no'' a shot.
