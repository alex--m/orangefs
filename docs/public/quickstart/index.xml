      <description>This topic provides an example of a complete installation of OrangeFS from source in a single procedure. It can also be used as a Quick Start reference for experienced users who wish to bypass the more detailed and segmented instructions in the earlier topics of this manual.
NotesÂ Most of the following steps require that you have root permissions.
If your distro includes the OrangeFS kernel module, you may skip tasks related to building and installing the kernel module.</description>
