This is an implementation of the trove interface which will not save persitent data.
TAS = Trove analysis stub should be used to measure the performance overhead of the 
pvfs2 layers between application and storage space.

The implementation is not completed and does not intend to provide all 
functionality and a well defined or even correct error handling as DBPF.
It is intendet to be used for performance evualuation only.
