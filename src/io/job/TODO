==========================================

- come back later and do some optimizing to avoid the flags
  argument to job_bmi_unexp().  This flag can be used to disable
  immediate completion, which is currently necessary in the server
  code to allow it to repost unexpected jobs correctly.  See
  mailing list thread:
  http://www.beowulf-underground.org/pipermail/pvfs2-internal/2003-February/000305.html

- make post functions avoid allocating a job descriptor if they
  immediately complete (right now, we allocate one whether its
  needed or not, really) 

- go back to everywhere that BMI_testXXX is called and do the
  right thing with the timeout flag (for now it is simply set to
  10 or 0 milliseconds in different cases)

- figure out if vtag field should come from trove test() or if it
  comes from the pointer passed in at post time

- bring example programs back up to speed

- finish implementing ability to test multiple collection, remove
  HACK_global_fsid

- be sure to turn off mutex locks for non-threaded version

- once unpost() is fully supported, attempt to unpost any pending
  operations at finalize time

- handle timeout / unpost situations

- consider using callback approach to limit number of threads (one per
  resource, rather than per API)

- make thread condition signalling more efficient (maybe try to avoid
  waking up testing processes unless something they were looking for
  completed)

- make job API thread safe (needed eventually for thread safe system
  interface API?

- make a client side build that doesn't include trove (and also doesn't
  need -ldb or -lpthread)
