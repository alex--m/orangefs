==========================================

- switch to using trove_testsome() instead of trove_test() once it is
  avaiable.

- figure out what the deal is with trove_collection_lookup() returning
  0 on immediate completion

- figure out if vtag field should come from trove test() or if it
  comes from the pointer passed in at post time

- bring example programs back up to speed

- get rid of HACK_global_fsid once we have resolved how the collection
  id should interact with the trove interface

- be sure to turn off mutex locks for non-threaded version

- once unpost() is fully supported, attempt to unpost any pending
  operations at finalize time

- remember to verify that bmi and flow interfaces are initialized at
  init time

- look into possibility of hash table in place of completion queue

- handle timeout / unpost situations

- evaluate IBM pthreads implementation

- add list support for BMI and trove
